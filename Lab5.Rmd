# How to fork a project of someone else
Top right hand "Fork" &#8594; this will create a copy of the repository into your  Github account
Then clone the repositry so you get a copy to your machine
by running the command 
&#8594;
git clone  https://github.com/a-hendivan/DAS_Bingo.git

# Master Vs Branch 
Always make a new branch to do the commits on , it is easier if at a time you need to pull the previous version . 
To create a new branch run the command <br />
&#8594; git branch name-3 <br />
and then you need to checkout <br />
&#8594; git checkout name-3

# Update 
After you have done that means we are  : 

 &#8226; a fork MYACCOUNTNAME/REPOSNAME  <br />
 &#8226; a clone of the fork  <br />
 &#8226; the fork MYACCOUNTNAME/REPOSNAME is the remote " origin" for my machine
