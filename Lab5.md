# How to fork a project of someone else

Top right hand “Fork” → this will create a copy of the repository into
your Github account Then clone the repositry so you get a copy to your
machine by running the command → git clone

# Master Vs Branch

Always make a new branch to do the commits on , it is easier if at a
time you need to pull the previous version . To create a new branch run
the command <br /> → git branch name-3 <br /> and then you need to
checkout <br /> → git checkout name-3

# Update

After you have done that means we are :

• a fork MYACCOUNTNAME/REPOSNAME <br /> • a clone of the fork <br /> •
the fork MYACCOUNTNAME/REPOSNAME is the remote " origin" for my machine
